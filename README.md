# Discord-Server-Utilities-Bot

Discord bot written in javascript with various commands for managing a discord. The process of managing a discord can be tedious, with the person having to click many things in order to do a simple task, and this bot aims to make the entire process quicker and less tedious.

I'm currently working on a typescript rewrite of this bot, if you want to check that out as well (https://github.com/newracket/Discord-Server-Utilities-Typescript/).
